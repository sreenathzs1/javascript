1.JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
2.It is a Case Senstive language.
3.One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById(). JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

JavaScript Variables:
There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
 -Using var
 -Using let
 -Using const
 JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.


The sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard is ES6 or ECMAScript 6. It is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

Difference between ES5 and ES6.
	// In ES5, we could only define the variables by using the var keyword.	
    // In ES6, there are two new ways to define variables that are let and const.

4.These files are accessed by HTML by using script tag (".js")
5.These script tag should be write in the body tag , because we write some tags in body tag only.

6.Conditions:
-if->we use if condition to check only on condition.
-if else->When we have more than one condition we use the if and else condition.
-if else if else->Whenever we have multiple conditions.

7.Operators:

7.1. Arithmetic Operators->Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators:+, -, _, /, _
JavaScript arithmetic operators are addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulus(%), increment(++) and decrement(--).

7.2 Logical Operators-> The following symbols are the common logical operators: &&(ampersand) , ||(pipe) and !(negation). && gets true only if the two operands are true. || gets true either of the operand is true. ! negates true to false, false to true.

7.3 Comparison Operators-.>Boolean value is either true or false. Any comparison return a boolean either true or false. Use all the following comparison operators to compare the following values: >, < >=, <=, !=, !==,===. Which are true or which are false ?
